### Behind the Scene 
When a user donates money to the dao she either sends money to the contributors pool (buy MOOS) or to the liquidity pool (buy Krill). 
- When sending money to the contributors pool the cryptos are used to pay contributors only. S/he deposita money and receives MOOS.
- If sending it to the liquidity pool the funds are used for providing liquidity for MOOS and Krill. S/he gets krill and her MOOS and $ are put evenly into 3 liquidity pools. 
- For example user sends 10$ into the liquidity pool. Then 10$ofMoos gets minted. She receives 10$ofKrill. 5$ and 5$ofMoos goes in the Moos/$ pool. 5$ and 5$ofKrill goes into the Krill/$ pool and 5$ofMoos and 5$ofKrill goes into the Moos/Krill pool. The Krill will get minted for the pools to match the moos and $ amounts.
